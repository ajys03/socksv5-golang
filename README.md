# SOCKS Protocol Version 5 (in Golang)
[SOCKS Protocol Version 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928#autoid-2)

Similar to the [C++ implementation](https://github.com/ajys03/socks-protocol-v5), 
I will be implementing a proxy server in Go. However, in this implementation,
we will add authentication.
